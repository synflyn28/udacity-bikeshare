# Udacity Bikeshare Project

This is the second project for Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree Program where
bike rideshare data for a few select cities (New York, Chicago, and Washington,
DC) are used to create a terminal application that gives a set of summary
statistics for each city. This is implemented in Python.

## Requirements
`Python 3.x` and `Pandas`.
